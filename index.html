    <!-- 
    
    1. Validations are used to set specific constraints or rules that determine what data users can enter into an input
    2. When a user enters data that breaks the rules a message will appear, providing feedback on what was wrong with the entered data and hot to fix it
    3. Validations are important for protecting backend systems from recieving incorrect data and for making the forms as simple as possible for the users
